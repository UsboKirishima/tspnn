![screen.png](/assets/screen.png)

Simple desktop app to resolve "Traveling Salesman Problem" using the Nearest Neighbor algorithm.



## What is tspnn?

*tspnn* is a simple client that includes several algorithms to solve the *Traveling Salesman Problem* (TSP) by finding the shortest path. It implements algorithms such as **Nearest Neighbor**, **2-Opt**, and others.

## How it works?

*tspnn* is a modular project, split into different packages (or modules). The main package is `@tspnn/core`, located in [/packages/core](/packages/core), which contains all the core logic and algorithms used by the program.

The other module is `@tspnn/desktop`, a simple desktop graphical application made in electron and located in [/packages/desktop](/packages/desktop).

## Contributions

*tspnn* is a project originally created for **academic purposes**, so I probably wonâ€™t continue working on this repository in the future. However, I truly appreciate anyone who wants to contribute by adding features, algorithms, or fixes through a [pull request](/pulls), as long as they are willing to make changes that align with the philosophy of the project.
